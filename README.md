# CHS Portfolio Assignment

This is part of the <a href="codehs.com">CodeHS</a> HTML course.
This is my portfolio website made in React TS.

# How to compile

For those who don't know, this is how you compile the website.

```
Run these in a command prompt, you'll need node (fully) installed.

1. npm install
2. npm install -g // If you don't have the CLIs downloaded
3. npm run build

```

# Live Example (Hosted By CodeHS)
